## Sobre gbPivot

Sakura is a dynamically-typed, interpreted, high-level, Turing-complete, programming language. It's designed for writing installer scripts, built with security, safety, and customization in mind. It is also designed to be easy to use for non-programmers to use, while giving enough control to perform more advanced tasks to users that require it. Sakura's main purpose is to interact with the file system, and provides many features to help make this simpler.
